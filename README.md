### RESUME🎮👨🏻‍💻

As the introduction said, I just created a new company (just imagine).I must decide where to locate the office according to my employees’ preferences, which are the following ones sorted by my decision criteria :

*Decision criteria: we are all the same in the company so majority preferences are first

- Everyone: near to pubs
- 30% of the company: near to kindergarten
- 20 Designers:  near companies that also do design.
- 20 Developers: near successful tech startups (raised at least $ 1M).
- 20 Account managers: near airport
- 10 Executives: like Starbucks
- 1 CEO: is vegan 

PS*You can find a detailed explanation of decision making in the WORK DEVELOPMENT section
